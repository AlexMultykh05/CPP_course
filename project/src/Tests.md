Recipe for Chicken Carbonara:
1. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water.
2. In a large skillet, cook chopped bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove bacon from skillet and set aside on paper towels to drain excess grease.
3. In the same skillet, add chicken strips and cook until golden brown and cooked through. Add minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.
4. In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese.
5. Add cooked spaghetti to the skillet with chicken and garlic. Pour the egg mixture over the spaghetti and toss quickly to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until desired consistency is reached.
6. Add crispy bacon to the skillet and toss to combine.
7. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with chopped parsley before serving.
